/* POST-SUBMIT NOTES */
 /*
1. DON'T EXCEED MAX LIMIT
        It is not enough to check that "Y" is less than max weight. You must make
        sure that "y + item to be added" won't go over the limit before adding it.

2. HEAVIEST THING
        Check if it is things.isEmpty() first. Then start with the first Thing
        which is this.things.get(index 0) and compare with each successive item
        in the list. If it's bigger, replace the "heaviest" variable.
